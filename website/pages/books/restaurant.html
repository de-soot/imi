					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>Facing annihilation at the hands of the warlike Vogons? Time for a cup of tea! Join the cosmically displaced Arthur Dent and his uncommon comrades in arms in their desperate search for a place to eat, as they hurtle across space powered by pure improbability.</p>

					<p>Among Arthur's motley shipmates are Ford Prefect, a longtime friend and expert contributor to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; Zaphod Beeblebrox, the three-armed, two-headed ex-president of the galaxy; Tricia McMillan, a fellow Earth refugee who's gone native (her name is Trillian now); and Marvin, the moody android. Their destination? The ultimate hot spot for an evening of apocalyptic entertainment and fine dining, where the food speaks for itself (literally).</p>

					<p>Will they make it? The answer: hard to say. But bear in mind that The Hitchhiker’s Guide deleted the term “Future Perfect” from its pages, since it was discovered not to be!</p>

						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.0/5.0 (Reviewed on 9 August 2024)</p>
						<p>I love Marvin and he really shines in this book. If you like a humorous scifi genre this book is for you.</p>

						<p><strong>Andrea Hall-Cuccia</strong></p>
						<p class="underline">Rating: 5.0/5.0 (Reviewed on 8 May 2024)</p>
						<p>This book continues to be rife with Douglas Adams' signature humor. The restaurant scenes are inventive, if a little disturbing. Marvin the Paranoid Android is back and has his moment in the sun. Ford and the others continue to romp across the universe having adventures. All in all, a fun continuation of the series.</p>
