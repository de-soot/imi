					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half, she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. ("The") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.</p>

						<p>Iâ€™ve read a lot from Roald Dahl, but this was my first time reading Matilda. I think I read the entire thing with a smile on my face. Such an amusing book. So hilarious and subversive. I loved it.</p>
