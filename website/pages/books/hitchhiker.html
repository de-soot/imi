					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>It’s an ordinary Thursday morning for Arthur Dent . . . until his house gets demolished. The Earth follows shortly after to make way for a new hyperspace express route, and Arthur’s best friend has just announced that he’s an alien.</p>

					<p>With just a towel, a small yellow fish, and a book, Arthur has to navigate through a very hostile universe in the company of a gang of unreliable aliens. Luckily the fish is quite good at languages. And the book is The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy . . . which helpfully has the words "DON'T PANIC" inscribed in large, friendly letters on its cover.</p>

					<p>Douglas Adams’s mega-selling pop-culture classic sends logic into orbit, plays havoc with both time and physics, offers up pithy commentary on such things as ballpoint pens, potted plants, and digital watches . . . and, most important, reveals the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything.</p>

						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.0/5.0 (Reviewed on 27 March 2008)</p>
						<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a a classic and often humorous work of science fiction. The book is a quick read and well written. While I believe that it might be slightly over-hyped by its fans, it is still a must read.</p>
