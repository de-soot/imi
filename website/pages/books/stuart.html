					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>Stuart Little is no ordinary mouse. Born to a family of humans, he lives in New York City with his parents, his older brother George, and Snowbell the cat. Though he's shy and thoughtful, he's also a true lover of adventure.</p>

					<p>Stuart's greatest adventure comes when his best friend, a beautiful little bird named Margalo, disappears from her nest. Determined to track her down, Stuart ventures away from home for the very first time in his life. He finds adventure aplenty. But will he find his friend?</p>

					<p>Stuart Little joins E. B. White favorites Charlotte's Web and The Trumpet of the Swan as classic illustrated novels that continue to speak to today's readers. Whether you curl up with your young reader to share these books or hand them off for independent reading, you are helping to create what are likely to be all-time favorite reading memories.</p>

					<h2>About the Author</h2>

					<p>Born in Mount Vernon, New York, Mr. White attended public schools there. He was graduated from Cornell University in 1921, worked in New York for a year, then traveled about. After five or six years of trying many sorts of jobs, he joined the staff of The New Yorker magazine, then in its infancy. The connection proved a happy one and resulted in a steady output of satirical sketches, poems, essays, and editorials. His essays have also appeared in Harper's Magazine, and his books include One Man's Meat, The Second Tree from the Corner, Letters of E.B. White, The Essays of E.B. White and Poems and Sketches of E.B. White. In 1938 Mr. White moved to the country. On his farm in Maine he kept animals, and some of these creatures got into his stories and books. Mr. White said he found writing difficult and bad for one's disposition, but he kept at it. He began Stuart Little in the hope of amusing a six-year-old niece of his, but before he finished it, she had grown up.</p>

						<p>E.B. White was a very unique, perceptive and extremely talented writer. He is best known for his books, Charlotte's Web, The Trumpet of the Swan and Stuart Little. This is a must have addition to any home library.</p>

						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.2/5.0 (Reviewed on 30 August 2022)</p>
						<p>In the genre of children's literature, the books that get passed from one generation to the next are those whose tales are full of adventure, imagination, and fine illustrations. This is one of those books. I read it as a child, I then read it to my children, and now I'm reading it to my grandchildren. 3 generations of enjoyment so far.</p>
