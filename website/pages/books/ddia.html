						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.7/5.0 (Reviewed on 3 June 2025)</p>
						<p>This book dives deep into its subject with clear structure and thoughtful explanations. The concepts are well-articulated and build on each other logically. However, to truly appreciate the depth and get the most out of it, I recommend reading it with some prior experience or familiarity with the topic. Overall, a highly valuable and rewarding read.</p>
