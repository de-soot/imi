					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>From the bestselling author of The BFG and Matilda comes the story of Charlie Bucket, Willy Wonka, and his infamous chocolate factory.</p>

					<p>Willy Wonka's famous chocolate factory is opening at last! But only five lucky children will be allowed inside. And the winners are: Augustus Gloop, an enormous boy whose hobby is eating; Veruca Salt, a spoiled-rotten brat whose parents are wrapped around her little finger; Violet Beauregarde, a dim-witted gum-chewer with the fastest jaws around; Mike Teavee, a toy pistol-toting gangster-in-training who is obsessed with television; and Charlie Bucket, Our Hero, a boy who is honest and kind, brave and true, and good and ready for the wildest time of his life!</p>

						<p>Reading this brought back so many memories, and I was in my happy place for the entire reading of this book. Roald Dahl was such a master of words and personification. He truly painted so many vivid and distinctive images in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</p>
