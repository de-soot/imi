					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>OSTEP ("oh step"), or the "the comet book", represents the culmination of years of teaching intro to operating systems to both undergraduates and graduates at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences department for nearly 25 years.The book is organized around three concepts fundamental to OS construction: virtualization (of CPU and memory), concurrency (locks and condition variables), and persistence (disks, RAIDS, and file systems). The material, if combined with serious project work and homeworks, will lead students to a deeper understanding and appreciation of modern operating systems. The authors, Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, are both professors of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. They have been doing research in computer systems for 30 years, working together since their first graduate operating systems class at U.C. Berkeley in 1993. Since that time, they have published over 100 papers on the performance and reliability of many aspects of modern computer systems, with a special focus on file and storage systems.</p>

					<h2>About the Authors</h2>

					<p>The authors, Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, are both professors of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. They have been doing research in computer systems for 30 years, working together since their first graduate operating systems class at U.C. Berkeley in 1993. Since that time, they have published over 100 papers on the performance and reliability of many aspects of modern computer systems, with a special focus on file and storage systems. Their work has been recognized with numerous best-paper awards, a test of time award, and some of their innovations can be found in the Linux and BSD operating systems today. Both were named ACM Fellows for "contributions to storage and computer systems" and both received the ACM-SIGOPS Mark Weiser award for "outstanding leadership, innovation, and impact in storage and computer systems research."</p>

						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.6/5.0 (Reviewed on 2 January 2020)</p>
						<p>I found this book to be a very approachable introduction to operating systems. It's full of great examples using the C language in a Unix environment, which is great for learning operating systems. Notably, the chapters are kept extremely short: this was a great decision by the authors, it makes the material more understandable. The text is not mathematically difficult but it's technical enough to deal with real systems. I've read it through a couple times and I'm sure I can get something out of it each time I read it. It has good exercises and references. It's one of my all-time favorite bed-time reading materials.</p>
