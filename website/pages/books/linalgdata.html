					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>Linear algebra and the foundations of deep learning, together at last! From Professor Gilbert Strang, acclaimed author of Introduction to Linear Algebra, comes Linear Algebra and Learning from Data, the first textbook that teaches linear algebra together with deep learning and neural nets. This readable yet rigorous textbook contains a complete course in the linear algebra and related mathematics that students need to know to get to grips with learning from data. Included are: the four fundamental subspaces, singular value decompositions, special matrices, large matrix computation techniques, compressed sensing, probability and statistics, optimization, the architecture of neural nets, stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation.</p>

						<p><strong>Richard Frantz Jr.</strong></p>
						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.6/5.0 (Reviewed on 30 August 2024)</p>
						<p>Gilbert Strang, well known MIT professor and author, writes another book on linear algebra. He put a lot of effort into making the material accessible and not assuming a background in linear algebra (matrices) so aimed at beginners. There is a bit of 'personal commentary' added to the text that is trying to make the public comfortable that wouldn't normally be in a text book but doesn't bother me much here. The added focus is on applications to Machine learning and other data extraction so it focuses on linear algebra that are useful for that purpose and how they are useful.</p>
