					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>Renowned professor and author Gilbert Strang demonstrates that linear algebra is a fascinating subject by showing both its beauty and value. While the mathematics is there, the effort is not all concentrated on proofs. Strang's emphasis is on understanding. He explains concepts, rather than deduces. This book is written in an informal and personal style and teaches real mathematics. The gears change in Chapter 2 as students reach the introduction of vector spaces. Throughout the book, the theory is motivated and reinforced by genuine applications, allowing pure mathematicians to teach applied mathematics.</p>

						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.2/5.0 (Reviewed on 10 November 2012)</p>
						<p>If you are taking Lin Alg then you have heard of Strang. This is his more advanced book on the topic and it is the be all end all of the topic. I have taken a couple grad courses that did not use this book but the instructor instead wanted to use an obscure text written by someone they knew. I bought this book and used it as a resource for both and it was worth every penny. Things i needed for the other courses were explained well and things that were not necessary were written in an interesting manner and i learned them on my own. I would love to have had him as my adviser or someone to just sit and have coffee with every morning and discuss math.</p>
