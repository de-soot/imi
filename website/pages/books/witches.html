					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>This is not a fairy tale. This is about real witches.</p>

					<p>Grandmamma loves to tell about witches. Real witches are the most dangerous of all living creatures on earth. There's nothing they hate so much as children, and they work all kinds of terrifying spells to get rid of them. Her grandson listens closely to Grandmamma's storiesâ€”but nothing can prepare him for the day he comes face-to-face with The Grand High Witch herself!</p>

						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.7/5.0 (Reviewed on 25 January 2023)</p>
						<p>I am 8 years old and have read 2 Roald Dahl books. Both were good, but the best by far was The Witches. People may say this book is scary and it is a little creepy, but you should not be scared by it. I especially loved Roald Dahl's funny and fun elements in the story! I think this book would be good for ages 6+.</p>
