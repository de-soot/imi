					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>From the bestselling author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The BFG comes the story of a young boy on a magical adventure. After James Henry Trotter's parents are tragically eaten by a rhinoceros, he goes to live with his two horrible aunts, Spiker and Sponge. Life there is no fun, until James accidentally drops some magic crystals by the old peach tree and strange things start to happen. The peach at the top of the tree begins to grow, and before long it's as big as a house. Inside, James meets a bunch of oversized friendsâ€”Grasshopper, Centipede, Ladybug, and more. With a snip of the stem, the peach starts rolling away, and the great adventure begins!</p>

						<p><strong>R. SEELYE</strong></p>
						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.7/5.0 (Reviewed on 25 January 2023)</p>
						<p>The quintessential reading experience for an 8 year old (in my opinion). This book was the gateway to me becoming an avid reader. Roald Dahl is the definition of a prolific children's author. Everything he has ever written has been a timeless hit. *I must admit, I am not a fan of the peach colored font used in this edition of the book.</p>
