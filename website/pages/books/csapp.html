						<p><strong>Tom Copeland</strong></p>
						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.2/5.0 (Reviewed on 10 September 2021)</p>
						<p>It's a well-written book that contains a lot of great material. Initially got this as a semester rental, but I'm going to pay the extra $100 and buy it. That said, not an easy read: it's required reading for one of my undergraduate classes and is a bit dense at times (chapter 2, for example, rigorously derives important properties of unsigned and signed integers). You'll also probably need some real experience using C or something before you can really grok it.</p>
