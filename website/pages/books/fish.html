					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>Back on Earth with nothing more to show for his long, strange trip through time and space than a ratty towel and a plastic shopping bag, Arthur Dent is ready to believe that the past eight years were all just a figment of his stressed-out imagination. But a gift-wrapped fishbowl with a cryptic inscription, the mysterious disappearance of Earth's dolphins, and the discovery of his battered copy of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy all conspire to give Arthur the sneaking suspicion that something otherworldly is indeed going on.</p>

					<p>God only knows what it all means. Fortunately, He left behind a Final Message of explanation. But since it’s light-years away from Earth, on a star surrounded by souvenir booths, finding out what it is will mean hitching a ride to the far reaches of space aboard a UFO with a giant robot. What else is new?</p>

						<p><strong>WTS</strong></p>
						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.4/5.0 (Reviewed on 30 May 2016)</p>
						<p>A great story, but not as good as the earlier books. This book is a continuation of Douglas Adams original Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is really 5+ stars, possibly because he redid it several times between the radio series, the books, and several iterations of movie scripts. So Long and Thanks for all the Fish does not seem quite as good, possibly because I have got used to his humor, or possibly because he did not have as many iterations to polish it. I just finished "Mostly Harmless", and it seems more of a let down, possibly for the same reasons. Don't get me wrong. Douglas Adams is a great writer, whose stories keep nothing sacred. I just think that the absurdity of the ideas eventually dulls the senses, and it does not seem as new and refreshing as the original stories.</p>
