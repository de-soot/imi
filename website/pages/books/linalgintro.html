					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>Linear algebra is something all mathematics undergraduates and many other students, in subjects ranging from engineering to economics, have to learn. The fifth edition of this hugely successful textbook retains all the qualities of earlier editions, while at the same time seeing numerous minor improvements and major additions. The latter include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A new chapter on singular values and singular vectors, including ways to analyze a matrix of data</li>
						<li>A new chapter on linear algebra in probability and statistics</li>
						<li>A new section on linear algebra and cryptography</li>
					</ul>

						<p>I never thought that linear algebra is that useful in real life. I was enrolled in a master program and my first course was computer vision. There were massive amount of math and mostly were linear algebra. I felt like I lacked all enough comfort with linear algebra and thought that I could have understood many topics much better if I got a good book. Hell, this book is awesome. It has all what I need specially SVD and PCA. I don't care much about solving problems as to understand the meaning of linear algebra and its logic. I must admit that prior reading this book I had good grasp of what a matrix is and how we can formulate our data as a matrix, which opened the world of applications I can apply all the techniques of linear algebra on. Dr.Gilbert is a man who knows how to deliver high quality information to you, but you as a reader must also have the role of analyzing what you read and try to find an application of interest in your head where you can practice what you read. I looked at 10s of books before deciding to buy this one, and the only book which I felt comfortable with was this one. The only problem is that this book is expensive, but in my opinion, this books deserves every dollar and is a must in any machine lerning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, game programer or any field engineer library.</p>
