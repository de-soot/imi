					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>From the bestselling author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The BFG. Someone's been stealing from the three meanest farmers around, and they know the identity of the thief—it's Fantastic Mr. Fox! Working alone they could never catch him; but now fat Boggis, squat Bunce, and skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and his family surrounded. What they don't know is that they're not dealing with just any fox—Mr. Fox would rather die than surrender. Only the most fantastic plan can save him now.</p>

						<p><strong>Tremaine L. Loadholt</strong></p>
						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.7/5.0 (Reviewed on 5 September 2024)</p>
						<p>I was in my "happy place" for two days, and I loved every moment of it! A children's tale such as this one will never get old. As an avid fan of the movie, this was my first time reading the book, and I have to say, I love it just a bit more than the film. I found delight as I turned each page, I smiled incredibly wide and laughed out loud at some of the descriptive scenes. I wanted so badly to have Kristofferson (Mrs. Fox's nephew) as a part of this book, but he's a movie-only character. That's the thing with movies adapted from books, you gain some extras and you lose some bits that are rather intriguing.</p>
