					<h2>Book Description</h2>

					<p>Unique among computer networking texts, the Seventh Edition of the popular Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach builds on the author’s long tradition of teaching this complex subject through a layered approach in a “top-down manner.” The text works its way from the application layer down toward the physical layer, motivating readers by exposing them to important concepts early in their study of networking.</p>

						<p><strong>Hope Alhaidari</strong></p>
						<p class="underline">Rating: 4.3/5.0 (Reviewed on 15 January 2018)</p>
						<p>Most books in computer networks start bottom-up. This is good for those who might be beginners or those who are just looking to get a high level understanding of the field since it starts with the bigger picture and gets to the complicated lower level stuff later. Computer networks might feel dry to some, so starting with the upper level layers to the lower level ones later can more easily grab readers' attention. As a result they're more likely to stay for the entire ride and see how great computer networks are. It provides interesting end of chapter interviews! It also mentions the history and its influence on computer networks, which one might not take away from a computer networks class even though it is the basis of the internet that we know today. Great book!</p>
